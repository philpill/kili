<p>It's holiday time once again!</p>
<p>After my trip out to Everest, I've been hankering for more of the same - Kilimanjaro would seem to be ideal: a few hundred metres higher, and still 'safe', and in a country I'd never been to before!</p>
<p><a href="http://everest.industrialnation.co.uk/"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-55 aligncenter" alt="Everest Basecamp" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/EBC.jpg" width="512" height="384" /></p>
<p></a></p>
<p>The downsides are: mosquitoes, the trip is only 10 days, mosquitoes, clashes with work and MOSQUITOES! (I hate mosquitoes...)</p>
<p>The plan is to go in February - this will be my last chance before rainy season starts in March.</p>
