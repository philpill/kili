<p>My plan to go to Kili during February fell through horribly. I'd forgotten that my passport was due to expire later this year (June) and that you couldn't travel without at least six months valid.</p>
<p>I duly sent away my passport with no guarantee as to when it would return. When my new one came back to me two weeks before the leaving date, I decided to postpone till next season, beginning in May.</p>
<p>There was already a few issues - a new job had just started, and I wasn't really prepared, equipment-wise. This did however, mean I would have to suffer what would turn out to be the coldest UK spring since records began. It's all been pretty miserable round here, to be honest.</p>
<p>BUT! May is rapidly approaching and the holiday is now booked!</p>
