<p>The weather for this trek covers such a range that it can be quite difficult to decide what to prepare for. Obviously it'd be best if you were prepared for everything, but that clashes with the notion of travelling light. I guess the best approach to take would be to take <em>as little as you can get away with</em>.</p>
<p>For me, this is taking hardly any long-sleeve mid layers and hoping I don't freeze my balls off on the final days. Last time I wore quite a few layers, I was sweating like crazy - I couldn't strip fast enough. Long-johns left me unable to take the legs off my convertible trousers and I made a mess of quite a lot of my clothes - you can't wash your sweaty clothes so you either have to put them on again later or have alternatives garments.</p>
<p>Generally, this time of year (late spring - March ~ May) is the wet season - absolute downpours to be expected in April. Having a look at <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=kilimanjaro+weather">general forecasts</a>, it doesn't seem to be too wet: precipitation at 10% ~ 20%. Temperatures at 10°c ~ 30°c.</p>
