<p>I woke up crazy early today, for no particular reason. Deciding to go for a piss at 5:30, I managed to forget which tent was mine and tried to get into someone else's not once, but twice (apologies, fellow trekkers!) I'm gonna have to start bringing a flag to stick on my door ...</p>
<p>Katherine turns 30 today! Mau made her an awesome cake. Happy birthday Kath!</p>

<p>We Â left camp at about 8:30 and would be heading up to Baranco Wall towards Barafu today for some scrambling - lots of fun. Rock climbing being my thing, I absolutely loved it.</p>

<p>H<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">owever, my joy was short-lived as I bitched endlessly about the distance we're walking. It felt like we were trudging for miles (8km). Today's hike would take about 8 hours.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I was disheartened by the distance, but today would be our last before summit night. We're nearly there!</span></p>
<p>Barafu Hut was a featureless rockland. There was nothing cheery about this place at all. The view outside our tent was spectacular tho' ...</p>

<p>I didn't realise until this point that there would be no rest day before we made our summit bid - we would be going up the mountain tonight, with just a few hours sleep. After today's walk, it wasn't really what I wanted to hear - today was grueling, tomorrow was guaranteed to be even harder.</p>
<p>We were to go to bed early tonight at 19:30 and get up at 23:30, ready to leave at midnight.</p>
