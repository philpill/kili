<p><img alt="Diamox" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/diamox.jpg" width="547" height="410" /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetazolamide">Diamox</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_sickness">AMS</a>. Prescription only (I got mine from <a href="http://www.nomadtravel.co.uk/c-4-travel-health-clinic.aspx">Nomad Travel Clinic</a>)</p>
<p>Acute mountain sickness is a bit of a mystery as to whom it affects - fitness level has no correlation to the likelihood of falling ill. The symptoms of AMS generally begin with a headache.</p>
<p>Usage: One tablet per day - half in the morning and half in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Diamox is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic">diuretic</a> which effectively means you have to drink more water, and you also need to piss more, so it's not a good idea to take before bed.</p>
<p>Afterthoughts:</p>
<p>I didn't take any Diamox in the end and didn't feel like I suffered any AMS. I got out of breath pretty fast, but I never really got any loss of appetite or headaches or anything. Ibrahim did run a heart rate/ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_oxygen_level">blood oxygen</a> test on us tho', and I came up with the worst results of all the group - a resting heart rate of about 110bps and a saturation level of about 70%. I think medically, that would be cause for worry.</p>
<p>We were told that for Diamox to work properly, you need to be taking it early on, with plenty of water. Past a certain point, there'd be no benefit as your body would have no time to adjust for the benefits.</p>
