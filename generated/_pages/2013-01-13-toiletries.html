I'm missing a trekking towel here - not sure where mine has gone. I may need to buy a new one. I also could do with some way to store all of this. I used a Tupperware box last time (although it did tear a hole in my over-stuffed bag).
The more astute will notice I seem to have a shitload of contact lens and eyeball-related stuff. I personally hate wearing glasses outdoors, and because I'm so shortsighted, I'm in real trouble if anything happens to my contacts which means I can't wear them. Having said that, I really should see if I can find smaller bottles of the solutions I'm taking (or at least, smaller containers to transfer them to).
The sewing kit will largely be unused I suspect, but I think I'll leave behind the thread and use dental floss instead, if it comes to that. I was told on my last trip that dental floss is stronger anyway.
The tubigrip (tubular support bandage) and Deep Heat, came in handy last time when I developed <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-knee-strain.htm">knee strain</a>Â in my left knee. I might get away without the tubigrip as I have trekking poles and an elasticated knee support this time round. I may take Deep Ice instead of Deep Heat - probably more appropriate for muscle strain.
Also still need to buy throat lozenges for those dusty trails ...
Still to buy: trek towel, throat lozenges, small bottle contact lens solution
Afterthoughts:
The elasticated knee support I bought was shite - it kept sliding off my knee and down my leg. I borrowed one Jackie had which was miles better - she works in sport so it was a professional piece of equipment and I'm not sure I've ever seen it on sale anywhere.
