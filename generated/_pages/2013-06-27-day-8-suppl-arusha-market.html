<p>Kath and Bob left to go on safari. Sucked. Hounded by guys trying to con tourists out of money. Bought some shit CDs for $20 which I left in the taxi back in disgust.</p>
<p>Saw a few bits and bobs around the city. Went back to lodge.</p>
<p>Left Jackie to her safari trip. Caught bus with Rongai crew - exchanged war stories.</p>

<p>Caught flight home at Kili airport. All was well.</p>
