I'm not sure why, but I've been neglecting my need for a travel visa. I suspect I might've read somewhere that you could get one upon arrival, but it seems like it might be easier to acquire one before I go.

<blockquote>Visas for Tanzania are available on arrival for some nationalities, but we strongly recommend that you get your visa before travelling, as delays of 1 ½ - 2 hours can occur when getting the visa on arrival at Dar Es Salaam airport.</blockquote>

Two weeks is cutting it a bit closer than I'd like (when there's no reason I couldn't have done this months ago), but luckily, this process shouldn't take more than one week. There're services for acquiring it faster if required (as fast as overnight if you pay extra and pick up the documents from the embassy yourself).

I've gone through a company called [Travcour](http://www.travcour.com/) as suggested by the Adventure Company. The site seems a bit dodge, but the process appears to be straightforward.

I just need to print and send off two forms, along with some payment details, my passport and two photos.

The cost for an express (24 hour process time) tourist single entry visa is £99 total, including return of my passport by Royal Mail Special Delivery.

* Tourist Single Entry Visa: £38
* Express Service: £12
* Travcour Service Charge: £40
* Royal Mail Special Delivery Return: £9
