The holiday didn't start off with the best of news: all sorts of aviation problems were being reported by the BBC.

All mostly nothings, but it did make me feel a tad apprehensive. However, I managed to make it to Heathrow T3 by about 5pm - a good four hours before takeoff. I'd later learn that the rest of my group would not have such a straightforward journey.

Had a bit of a mooch about the terminal and my last Pret meal before checking in both my bags - I'd be holding nothing but my Kindle, money and ID. Tried to spot a few of my fellow trekkers by their boots as Adventure Co. has stopped sending us the cool red luggage tags I had on my first trip. I think I actually saw Gemma and Jay quite early on.

(Turns out Jay would also be climbing Kili with Adventure Co., but via a different route ... Lemosho, maybe?)

To add to the days aviation problems, my flight was delayed by a good hour and a half, thanks to the bay doors being stuck.

We got to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia around 8 in the morning. I managed to get lost heading to my connecting terminal, somehow ending up somewhere completely different. After a moment of panic, I hopped on little bus to take me to the correct terminal, where I caught sight of Gemma! I also noticed James and Sherril at this point, but I was still guessing and not approaching anyone (in a typical Londoner style). The waiting area was pretty awful, and the toilets even worse. Terminal 2 of Addis Ababa isn't so bad, but Terminal 1 is pretty bleak.

The connecting flight to Kilimanjaro was also late by over an hour as we waited for for some connecting passengers from Washington DC, then for their luggage.

While I was in the bog, the captain made an announcement that we were flying over Mt Kilimanjaro! Unfortunately, he told everyone it was on the right side, which actually turned out to be [Mt Meru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Meru_(Tanzania))! Kili was actually on the other side, haha.

Finally got to Kilimanjaro airport which was actually kinda nice! The place was scenic and pretty serene.

I spoke to Gemma and unknowingly to James' grandparents who were on the same flights but were just on holiday. Also stopped to talk to a little family who were with Adventure Co. on safari sorta trip while I was filling out my landing card with Jay and Gemma.

I got stopped and asked for my yellow fever certificate which was in my rucksack! I got away with telling them I was from the UK and showing the guy my passport. Also got electronically finger-printed which was odd for me.

Picked up my bags with some relief (I'd never done a connecting flight on my own before - wasn't sure if I needed to pick-up and re-check-in my bags at Addis) and went outside to meet the man (Ibrahim) with the Adventure Co. sign! (or was it Tropical Trails? I forget ...)

I got into a rockin' little jeep and met some more of my group - Sherril and James and it was off to [Karama Lodge](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g297913-d660649-Reviews-Karama_Lodge_Spa-Arusha_Arusha_Region.html)!

The rooms and indeed, the whole place was really nice. The view out the lounge was that of Kili itself and all the staff were good to us. There was a pool and a spa and hot showers ... place was awesome! I shared a room with James who had to put up with my snoring.

(Forgot to mention - place was awesome apart from a cockroach in Bob's dinner. He just pushed it out to the side of his plate, cool as a cucumber, and carried on eating!)

We met with Kath and her Dad Bob at the prep and learned that we would be joined by a seventh member: Jackie, later on, at Machame Gate.
