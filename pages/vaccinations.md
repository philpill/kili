title: Vaccinations

I have to admit, the potential for falling ill in Africa scares the crap out of me. I already have an exaggerated propensity to mosquito bites and after seeing all those charity adverts over Christmas, what with the starving, malnourished, disease-ridden, bony babies and flies swarming all over their bony faces, it almost feels like the land of Africa doesn't actually want people living on her.
So ... what do I need to vaccinate myself against? The basic list seems to be as follows:

* Hepatitis A
* Hepatitis B
* Meningitis
* Rabies
* Typhoid
* Yellow Fever

I'll be going back to [Nomad](http://www.nomadtravel.co.uk/c-4-travel-health-clinic.aspx) as yet again, I've been too lazy to sort out a GP. For the more organised, here's what is available for free on the NHS:

* Flu
* Pneumococcal
* Whooping Cough
* Chicken Pox
* Hepatitis B
* Tubercolosis
* Polio
* Typhoid
* Hepatitis A (first dose only)
* Cholera

See the '[adult vaccines](http://www.nhs.uk/Planners/vaccinations/Pages/Adultshub.aspx)' and '[travel vaccines](http://www.nhs.uk/Planners/vaccinations/Pages/traveljabsonthenhs.aspx)' pages on the NHS site for more details.
Let's see ... so given my [previous vaccinations](http://everest.industrialnation.co.uk/vaccinations/), what do I need? I need:

* Hepatitis A booster
* Hepatitis B booster
* Yellow Fever

I'm also needing some sort of [anti-malarial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimalarial_medication). I've heard all sorts of horrible stories about the side-effects of anti-malarial drugs and the symptoms of malaria. There's all sorts of debates about whether the side-effects of the drugs are worth the protection, but I won't be taking the chance - I'm far too wussy to be falling ill in a foreign country.

[Y](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_fever)[ellow Fever](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_fever) is a bit of a weird one. Nomad advises that I don't really need it, being that I won't be around in the danger zones long enough to contract it but Tanzania might require that I have a [Certificate of Vaccination](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Yellow-fever/Pages/Prevention.aspx) anyway, despite not even arriving from a country at risk. I can chance on an exemption certificate instead, but I think given I'll possibly be heading out into other 'at-risk' areas in the future, I might just get the shot.

Update 30/04/13:

Got the yellow fever shot and malaria tablets ([Malarone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atovaquone/proguanil)) to the tune of about £130 (accidentally chucked the receipt, dammit, but it was about £80 for the anti-malarials and £50 for the shot). You can see the all-important yellow fever certificate in the image above.
The yellow fever vaccine is a 'live' vaccine and gave me some flu-ish symptoms for a day (some headache, gunkiness - took the day off work).
I was given 18 tablets - to start 1 day before I enter the country and conclude 1 week after I return. I was given a choice of which I wanted, along with a list of all their side effects and to be honest, they all sounded horrible. I went for the most expensive as the next best option would require that I pop pills for a month after I return and possibly burn to a crisp in the sun (increased photo-sensitivity).
