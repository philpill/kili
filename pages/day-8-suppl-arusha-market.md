Kath and Bob left to go on safari. Sucked. Hounded by guys trying to con tourists out of money. Bought some shit CDs for $20 which I left in the taxi back in disgust.
Saw a few bits and bobs around the city. Went back to lodge.
Left Jackie to her safari trip. Caught bus with Rongai crew - exchanged war stories.

Caught flight home at Kili airport. All was well.
